# Layout Gallery
I'm going to put all of my experimental layouts here, the aim is to create a library of flexbox layouts for websites and potential web apps 

# Intent 
My intent is to attempt to learn to create slick, simple layouts that I can use as a 'base' for web pages 

Tech 

- Sass (will try and explore some of its more advanced features, may follow BEM)
- HTML (but potentially jade, kind of like the look of it)
